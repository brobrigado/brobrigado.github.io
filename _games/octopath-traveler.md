## Review
Octopath Traveler is light, but fun 20 hour JRPG. Unfortunately, the game lasts about 40-50 hours.

### Story
Octopath Traveler has a very unique story structure. There are 8 main characters each with their own independant storyline. They do not merge with another and can be played in any order. During one character's story, all other characters in your party become faceless ghost helper's solely used in combat.

This freeform story is great in that it lets you explore the world at will, but really hurts the character development. The character's ocassionaly interact with each other at key story moments, but they tend to be quick anecdote's or shallow conversations. I'd be great to see Ophilia's love for her sister help Therion learn to trust again, or for Cyrus to come up with a cure for Hannit's master. Unfortunately, the game is created so that you could play through Hannit's whole story without ever meeting Cyrus. This freedom comes at the price of meaningful character interaction.

The stories themselves are simple, and a little generic. Each character has a goal sending them across the continent, and has a small handful of supporting characters. The character arc's also seems fairly weak. They claim to have grown as a person, but I don't feel like they really earned it. This setup is also really terrible if the story has some kind of mystery. Trying to set up a mystery character is just silly when there are about 2 other characters involved in the story.

### Mission Design
_Every time you enter a new town, the game follows a simple formula:_

1. Story bit
1. Explore town using a character's special ability
1. Dungeon
1. Boss
1. Story bit

This gameplay loop is a true classic and still holds up today. Unfortunately, following this exact formula every time means that nothing feels special. Discovering a long lost pirate treasure feels exactly like hunting a beast in the forest. The scholar's search for a stolen forbidden tome plays out just like the Dancer's quest for revenge. When all the characters and storylines feel the same, it makes everything interchangable and unimportant. 

### Combat
The combat is tactical and interesting, and is the best part of Octopath Traveller. Finding the correct timing to break an enemies' shield right when your most powerful attacks come online is very satisfying and my favorite part of the game. It feels like solving a puzzle as opposed to most JRPG battles of attrition. Unfortunately, it's a puzzle you will encounter thousands of times over and over again. By the end of the first chapter, the combat already began to wear on me. The enemies are tactically not varied enough, and they start repeating early on. Frog Guy IV is just Frog Guy I with better stats and more shields. 

Another unfortunate side effect of this puzzle based combat is that every encounter takes forever. Even the most jobber of enemy groups can take 3-4 turns to defeat. Combat tends to follow a cycle of build up turns into a big attack turn. If you can not defeat your enemies by the end of the attack turn, your are basically locked into another cycle.

### Graphics
The game looks great in motion. The 3D world with old school map design and the unique particle effects for each environment looks awesome and was a joy to explore. The animations and effects also did a lot to enhance the combat. Your power attacks really clobbered the enemy and made it worth the multiple turns of setup. All in all, great job.

### Final Thoughts
While I defenitely had some fun playing Octopath Traveler, my final verdict is that it is not a good game. A few twists to the basic formula could have done a lot to keep me interested, and more meaningful interaction between the party members could have saved this game.
